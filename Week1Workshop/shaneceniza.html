        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born and raised in the Bronx in New York City to Filipino immigrants.</li>
            <li>I still currently live in the Bronx.</li>
            <li>The best job I've â€‹ever had was working as a student aide at a theatre summer camp for children. It was a blast helping
            coach students and putting together a show with them!</li>
            <li>I left medical school after 3 months and decided to see if software engineering is a viable career path for me.</li>
